# Real-Time RAG Brain

## Initial Concept
An autonomous intelligence substrate integrating streaming data, knowledge graphs, and vector databases to create a living, updating digital brain.

## Target Users
*   **Data Scientists & AI Engineers:** Professionals seeking a platform to build and deploy autonomous agents capable of learning and adapting in real-time.
*   **Enterprise Organizations:** Businesses requiring advanced real-time knowledge management systems to derive insights from vast streams of corporate data.
*   **Research Institutions:** Groups conducting complex analysis on streaming data to uncover dynamic entity relationships and evolving patterns.

## Core Features
*   **Real-Time Data Ingestion:** High-throughput ingestion and processing of streaming data using Redpanda (Kafka) to ensure low-latency data availability.
*   **Automated Knowledge Extraction:** Sophisticated pipelines utilizing spaCy and Transformers to autonomously extract entities and relationships from unstructured text streams.
*   **Hybrid Retrieval System:** A powerful memory architecture that combines the structural reasoning of Knowledge Graphs (Neo4j) with the semantic similarity search of Vector Databases (Qdrant/Milvus) for comprehensive context retrieval.
