# Product Guidelines

## Documentation Style
*   **Concise and Direct:** Prioritize clarity by using short sentences and bullet points to convey technical information efficiently.
*   **Detailed Rationale:** Provide comprehensive context and technical depth when explaining architectural decisions and complex logic.
*   **Onboarding Focused:** Incorporate step-by-step tutorials and practical examples to ensure a smooth learning curve for new developers and users.

## Architectural Principles
*   **Modular and Extensible:** Maintain loose coupling between components (Ingestion, Processing, Extraction, Memory) to facilitate independent scaling and technology swaps (e.g., changing vector providers).
*   **Observability-First:** Integrate comprehensive logging, monitoring, and tracing throughout the pipeline to provide real-time visibility into the system's state and performance.
*   **Security and Privacy:** Implement rigorous data isolation and secure communication protocols to protect sensitive information across the distributed infrastructure.

## Brand Voice and Messaging
*   **Innovative and Cutting-Edge:** Position the project as a forward-thinking substrate for autonomous intelligence and real-time learning.
*   **Reliable and Enterprise-Ready:** Emphasize the system's stability, scalability, and suitability for mission-critical production environments.
*   **Open and Collaborative:** Foster a transparent development environment that encourages community participation and open architectural discourse.
