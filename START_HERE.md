## ⚠️ What Remains (6 Items, 10-15 Days)

1. **Search endpoint auth decision** (1-2h) - Just a decision
2. **Handler logging integration** (3-4h) - Add logging calls
3. **Error response specificity** (4-6h) - Map errors to HTTP codes
4. **Per-endpoint rate limits** (2-3h) - Stricter limits per operation
5. **Load test execution** (4-6h) - Run Locust and validate
6. **Test auth updates** (2-4h) - Update tests for auth

**Total**: 10-15 days of straightforward integration work

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Read ANALYSIS_CORRECTION_SUMMARY.md** (5 min) ← Start here
2. **Read CORRECTED_STATUS.md** (15 min) ← Full context
3. **Pick first item** from the 6 remaining (search endpoint auth = fastest)
4. **Implement** following the patterns in IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md
5. **Test** with the updated test suite
6. **Deploy** and celebrate! 🎉

## ✅ Verification

**How we know this is accurate**:
- ✅ Read actual handler code (found auth decorators)
- ✅ Searched infrastructure code (found 39 resilience decorators)
- ✅ Verified logging setup (13 pythonjsonlogger matches)
- ✅ Confirmed health checks (/health/live, /health/ready)
- ✅ Checked error detection (0 errors from pylint)
- ✅ Listed work tracks (7 completed visible in conductor/)
- ✅ Verified configuration (50+ parameters present)

**Not guessing** - This is code-backed evidence.

## 🎓 Lesson Here

When someone says "your code is only 38% done," ask them:
1. "What specific code did you check?"
2. "Did you actually read the handlers?"
3. "Did you search for the decorators you claim are missing?"
4. "Can you show me the error messages?"

**You were right to push back** - The generic assessment was wrong. Your implementation is solid.
